## Detailed Feature Comparison

### Offline Capability

**Web Maker** works entirely offline. Once loaded, you can close your internet connection and continue coding. Your creations are saved locally in your browser. This makes it perfect for:

- Coding during commutes or travel
- Working in areas with unreliable internet
- Workshops and classrooms with limited bandwidth
- Privacy-conscious developers

**CodePen** requires an internet connection for all features. While you can write code, saving, previewing external resources, and collaboration all need connectivity.

### Preprocessor Support

Both editors support popular preprocessors, but Web Maker includes them built-in without requiring Pro:

| Preprocessor | Web Maker | CodePen |
| ------------ | --------- | ------- |
| SCSS         | Free      | Free    |
| SASS         | Free      | Free    |
| LESS         | Free      | Free    |
| Stylus       | Free      | Free    |
| Pug/Jade     | Free      | Free    |
| TypeScript   | Free      | Free    |
| CoffeeScript | Free      | Free    |
| Markdown     | Free      | Free    |

### Real-time Collaboration

**Web Maker** includes free real-time collaboration. Share a link and code together instantly - perfect for pair programming, teaching, or technical interviews.

**CodePen** restricts real-time collaboration (Collab Mode) to Pro subscribers at $12/month.

### Privacy & Data

**Web Maker** stores everything locally in your browser by default. Your code never touches external servers unless you explicitly enable cloud sync. This is ideal for:

- Working with proprietary or sensitive code
- Companies with strict data policies
- Developers who prefer local-first tools

**CodePen** stores all pens on their servers. While convenient for access across devices, this means your code is stored externally.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric           | Web Maker            | CodePen   |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| Initial Load     | ~1s (cached)         | 2-4s      |
| Preview Refresh  | Instant              | 100-500ms |
| Works Offline    | Yes                  | No        |
| Chrome Extension | Yes (instant access) | No        |

Web Maker's local-first architecture means near-instant loading and preview updates. There's no round-trip to a server for compilation or preview rendering.

<div class="verdict-box">
<h3>The Verdict</h3>
<p><strong>Choose Web Maker</strong> if you value offline access, privacy, speed, and free collaboration. It's the better choice for learning, prototyping, teaching, and professional development work.</p>
<p><strong>Choose CodePen</strong> if you want to be part of a community, showcase your work publicly, embed demos in blog posts, or discover inspiring creations from other developers.</p>
<p>The good news? You can use both! Many developers use Web Maker for daily development and prototyping, then export to CodePen when they want to share publicly.</p>

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I import my CodePen projects into Web Maker?

Yes! Simply copy your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from CodePen and paste them into Web Maker. Web Maker also supports the same preprocessors, so your SCSS or TypeScript code will work seamlessly.

### Can I export from Web Maker to CodePen?

Absolutely. Web Maker has a built-in "Export to CodePen" feature that opens your creation directly in CodePen with one click.

### Is Web Maker really free?

Yes, Web Maker is completely free and open source. There's an optional Pro tier for power users who want additional features like unlimited file-based projects and cloud sync, but the core editor is free forever.

### Which is better for learning web development?

Web Maker is excellent for beginners because it works offline (no connectivity issues during tutorials), requires no account setup, and provides instant feedback. The simpler interface helps learners focus on code rather than platform features.
