title: 'From the developer'
---

Hi! I am [Kushagra Gour](https://twitter.com/chinchang457), a frontend developer from India. I created Web Maker as a side project from myself because I wanted a frontend playground that was fast and didn't have to rely on network latency to generate realtime preview. Also something which I could use whenever and wherever I wanted, even wihtout Internet! I have written articles about why and how I created Web Maker and how you can benefit from it as a developer.
