## Why Educators Choose Web Maker

The biggest barrier to teaching web development isn't the concepts - it's the tooling. Before Web Maker, a typical first class might include:

- 30 minutes helping students install VS Code
- 20 minutes troubleshooting "Why doesn't my file open in the browser?"
- 15 minutes explaining file extensions
- Finally, some actual learning

**With Web Maker, your first class is coding from minute one.**

## Classroom Scenarios

### Lecture Demonstrations

Project Web Maker on the big screen and code live. Students see both your code and the result simultaneously. Change a CSS property and watch the preview update - concepts click faster with visual feedback.

### Hands-On Labs

Share a starting template with your class. Everyone opens the same link and has identical code to work from. No "my version looks different" confusion.

### Live Code Reviews

Ask a student to share their link. Review their code together as a class, make improvements in real-time, and everyone learns from the discussion.

### Remote Teaching

Web Maker's collaboration feature works perfectly for remote instruction. Share your screen or share a link - students can follow along either way.

## Features Educators Love

### Instant Setup for Any Class Size

Whether you have 5 students or 500, setup is the same: share a URL. Works on:

- Windows PCs
- Macs
- Chromebooks
- Linux machines
- Tablets

### Reliable Offline Mode

We've all been there: the school WiFi goes down during class. With Web Maker, teaching continues uninterrupted because everything runs locally.

### Preprocessor Support When Ready

Start students with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics. When they're ready to advance:

- Introduce **SCSS** for better CSS organization
- Move to **TypeScript** for type safety
- Explore **Pug** for HTML templating

All in the same familiar interface.

### No Accounts for Students

Students don't need to create accounts or remember another password. They can optionally sign up later if they want cloud sync.

## Curriculum Integration

### Web Development 101

Perfect for introductory courses covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. The three-pane layout mirrors the separation of concerns you're teaching.

### Frontend Bootcamps

Fast-paced bootcamps benefit from zero setup time. Spend every minute on learning, not configuration.

### Design Courses

Designers learning to code appreciate the immediate visual feedback. Change a color, see it instantly.

### Computer Science Programs

Supplement theory with hands-on practice. Students can experiment with concepts discussed in lecture.

## Workshop Best Practices

### Before the Workshop

1. Create a starting template with any boilerplate code
2. Test the link works from different devices
3. Prepare backup offline access instructions

### During the Workshop

1. Have students bookmark Web Maker at the start
2. Use the collaboration feature for live demos
3. Let students experiment - they can't break anything

### After the Workshop

1. Students keep their code forever (saved locally)
2. Share a link to continue where you left off
3. Point them to the docs for self-study

## Real Educator Experiences

Teachers and instructors around the world use Web Maker:

> "My students used to spend the first week just setting up their development environment. Now we're building websites on day one."

> "The offline mode is a game-changer for teaching in schools with unreliable internet."

> "I love being able to share a link and have everyone working from the exact same starting point."

## Resources for Educators

### Starter Templates

Create your own templates for common lessons:

- Basic HTML page structure
- CSS Flexbox playground
- JavaScript DOM manipulation starter
- Responsive design breakpoints

### Assessment Ideas

- Have students recreate a design mockup
- Build a specific feature from scratch
- Debug intentionally broken code
- Extend a provided template

### Supplementary Materials

Pair Web Maker with:

- MDN Web Docs for reference
- freeCodeCamp for structured curriculum
- CSS-Tricks for design inspiration
- JavaScript.info for deep dives

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can students save their work?

Yes, work is automatically saved in the browser. They can also download files or export to CodePen.

### Is there a teacher dashboard?

Currently, Web Maker focuses on the coding experience. For class management, pair it with your existing LMS.

### Can I see student code?

Students can share their creation links with you for review. Real-time collaboration lets you view and edit together.

### Is there a limit to class size?

No limits! Share a link with as many students as needed.

### What about academic honesty?

Each student works in their own browser instance with their own code. The tool doesn't enable copying from other students.
