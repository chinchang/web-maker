## Why Students Love Web Maker

Learning to code is challenging enough without fighting with tooling. Web Maker removes all the friction so you can focus on what matters: **understanding how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together**.

### Perfect for Your First HTML Page

Remember the excitement of seeing your first webpage come to life? Web Maker captures that magic:

1. Type some HTML in the left pane
2. Watch it appear instantly in the preview
3. Add CSS to make it beautiful
4. Add JavaScript to make it interactive

No terminal commands. No configuration files. No "it works on my machine" problems.

### Built for Learning

> "I wish I had Web Maker when I was learning. It would have saved me hours of setup frustration."

**Follow along with any tutorial** - Whether you're taking a course on Udemy, following freeCodeCamp, or working through a textbook, Web Maker is the perfect companion. Just type the code and see results instantly.

**Experiment freely** - The best way to learn is by breaking things. Make mistakes, see what happens, and learn from them without any consequences.

**Save your progress** - Your creations are automatically saved locally. Come back to them later, even without internet.

## Classroom-Ready Features

### Works on School Computers

Many schools have locked-down computers where you can't install software. Web Maker runs entirely in the browser - if you have Chrome, you have Web Maker.

### No Account Required

Start coding without creating yet another account. Your work saves locally, and you can optionally sign in later to sync across devices.

### Share with Classmates

Need help with your code? Share a link with your study group or instructor. They can see your code instantly and even collaborate in real-time.

### Export Your Work

When you're ready to submit an assignment:

- Download your files
- Export to CodePen for a shareable link
- Copy the compiled HTML/CSS/JS

## Student Success Stories

Students around the world use Web Maker for:

- **Computer Science classes** - Learning web fundamentals
- **Bootcamp prep** - Getting ready for coding bootcamps
- **Self-study** - Following online courses
- **Portfolio projects** - Building projects to showcase
- **Hackathons** - Quick prototyping under time pressure

## Tips for Students

### Start Small

Begin with simple HTML pages before adding CSS and JavaScript. Master each layer before combining them.

### Use the Console

Click the console button to see JavaScript output and errors. It's essential for debugging.

### Save Often

While Web Maker auto-saves, it's good practice to create multiple creations for different projects.

### Explore the Preprocessors

Once you're comfortable with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, try SCSS for better CSS organization or TypeScript for safer JavaScript.
