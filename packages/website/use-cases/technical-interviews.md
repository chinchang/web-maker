## Why Use Web Maker for Interviews

Most coding interview tools treat frontend development as an afterthought. They're built for algorithms and data structures, not DOM manipulation, CSS layouts, or JavaScript event handling.

**Web Maker is built for frontend.** Candidates see a real preview of their work, just like actual development.

## Interview Scenarios

### Live Coding Sessions

The classic technical interview, improved:

1. Share a Web Maker link with the candidate
2. Present a challenge (a blank canvas or starter code)
3. Watch them code in real-time
4. Discuss their approach as they work
5. See the actual rendered output

### Take-Home Refinement

After reviewing a take-home assignment, use Web Maker for the follow-up:

- Have the candidate walk through their code
- Ask them to make modifications live
- Discuss trade-offs and alternative approaches

### Pair Programming Rounds

True pair programming, not just watching:

- Both interviewer and candidate can edit
- Natural back-and-forth collaboration
- Simulate real team dynamics

### System Design Implementation

After whiteboarding a frontend architecture:

- Prototype the key components
- Validate the design works in practice
- Identify edge cases through implementation

## What You Can Assess

### HTML/CSS Skills

- **Semantic markup** - Do they use the right elements?
- **Accessibility** - Are they thinking about a11y?
- **CSS architecture** - How do they organize styles?
- **Responsive design** - Can they handle multiple viewports?
- **Layout techniques** - Flexbox, Grid, positioning

### JavaScript Proficiency

- **DOM manipulation** - querySelector, event listeners
- **Modern syntax** - ES6+, async/await
- **Problem-solving** - Algorithm implementation
- **State management** - Handling data flow
- **Error handling** - Edge cases and validation

### Framework Knowledge

With preprocessor support, assess:

- **TypeScript** - Type safety and interfaces
- **SCSS** - CSS preprocessor skills
- **Component thinking** - Even without React/Vue

### Soft Skills

- **Communication** - Explaining their thought process
- **Collaboration** - How they receive feedback
- **Problem decomposition** - Breaking down complex tasks
- **Time management** - Working within constraints

## Sample Interview Questions

### CSS Layout Challenge

_"Create a responsive card grid that shows 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, and 3 on desktop."_

Good candidates will:

- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox appropriately
- Consider mobile-first approach
- Handle edge cases (odd number of cards)

### JavaScript DOM Challenge

_"Build a todo list where items can be added, marked complete, and deleted."_

Good candidates will:

- Structure HTML semantically
- Use event delegation
- Handle empty states
- Consider accessibility (keyboard navigation)

### Debug Challenge

_"Here's a broken component. Find and fix the bugs."_

Provide intentionally buggy code and observe:

- How they diagnose issues
- Their debugging approach
- Communication while problem-solving

### CSS Animation Challenge

_"Create a loading spinner using only CSS."_

Evaluates:

- CSS animation understanding
- Creative problem-solving
- Attention to detail

## Interview Best Practices

### Before the Interview

1. **Test the link** - Make sure collaboration is working
2. **Prepare starter code** - Don't make candidates type boilerplate
3. **Set expectations** - Tell candidates what to expect

### During the Interview

1. **Explain the environment** - Show them the three panes and preview
2. **Start easy** - Let them get comfortable with the tool
3. **Think aloud** - Encourage verbalization of thought process
4. **Guide, don't solve** - Help when stuck, but let them drive

### After the Interview

1. **Save the code** - Export or screenshot for notes
2. **Discuss the solution** - There's learning opportunity for both parties
3. **Provide feedback** - Specific, actionable observations

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it really real-time?

Yes, both parties see changes as they're typed with minimal latency.

### What if the internet is unreliable?

Web Maker works offline. If connection drops mid-interview, both parties retain their code locally and can reconnect.

### Can I record the session?

Web Maker doesn't have built-in recording, but you can use screen recording software alongside it.

### Is the code saved after the interview?

Yes, both parties have their own copy saved locally. You can also export or screenshot for records.

### Can candidates cheat?

Web Maker doesn't prevent copy-paste or tab switching. For high-stakes assessments, combine with video proctoring.

### What about backend questions?

Web Maker is frontend-focused. For full-stack interviews, use it for the frontend portion and another tool for backend.
